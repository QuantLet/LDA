We deal with nonparametric estimation of the pricing kernel (PK) given by the ratio of the risk-neutral density estimator and the historical density (HD). The former density can be represented as the second derivative w.r.t. the European call option price function, which we estimate by nonparametric regression. HD is estimated nonparametrically too. In this framework, we develop the asymptotic distribution theory of the Empirical Pricing Kernel (EPK) in the L∞ sense. Particularly, to evaluate the overall variation of the pricing kernel, we develop a uniform confidence band of the EPK. Furthermore, as an alternative to the asymptotic approach, we propose a bootstrap confidence band. The developed theory is helpful for testing parametric specifications of pricing kernels and has a direct extension to estimating risk aversion patterns.
